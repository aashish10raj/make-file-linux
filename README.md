# make-file-linux


Write a C program to read student records from a student.txt file.
The information is in the following format.
Id Name Year CourseCode
A student can take multiple courses. 
A typical file can look something like below:
-----------------------
1 Astha 2 101
5 Dinesh 1 105
3 Rajesh 1 106
1 Astha 2 106
6 Amit 4 109
-----------------------

Read the data from the student.txt file and store it in a suitable data structure.
The operations that should be allowed are 
1. List the courses taken by a particular student
2. List the students enrolled for a particular year
3. List students enrolled for a particular course
Take input from the user to perform the above operations.

Maintain different C files for different tasks such as 
- file operations in a separate file
- data structure operations in a separate file
Divide operations suitably in different files.

Use "Makefile" to compile different files and execute the program.
